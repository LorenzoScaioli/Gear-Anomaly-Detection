# Gear Anomaly Detection

**Machine Learning for Computer Vision**  
Project Work – University of Bologna

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 🔧 `scripts/`  
This folder contains three main Bash scripts to run the project:

- `run_cd.sh` – Executes the training process.
- `eval.sh` – Runs the evaluation using the method described in the BIT model paper.
- `eval_instances.sh` – Runs our custom evaluation method.

> ℹ️ The custom evaluation logic is implemented in `eval_instances.py`.

---

### 🧠 `models/trainer.py`  
Contains the most important changes to implement the **weighted loss function**.

---

### 💾 `checkpoints/`  
Stores the training outputs (excluding the saved model files due to memory limitations).

---

### 🧹 `dataset/preprocess/`  
Contains the data preprocessing pipeline:

- `Dataset_ROBOFLOW_augmented/` – Final output of the preprocessing.
- `roboflow_original/` – The original dataset.
- `data_preprocess.ipynb` – Notebook that describes and implements the preprocessing steps.

> 🗂️ Intermediate folders generated by the notebook are not included in the repository.

---

### 📊 `output_analysis/`  
Contains:

- Predicted images and results generated by our **custom evaluator**.
- The folder `examples_segmented_images_1_1/`, which includes sample images generated by `eval_instances.py` during evaluation.

## 📝 Final Notes

This project focuses on applying **Computer Vision** techniques for detecting anomalies in gears, with special attention to custom evaluation strategies and dataset preprocessing.
